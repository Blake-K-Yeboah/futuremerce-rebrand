    "answer": "Great question! Hiring a really good Shopify expert can cost more than $100,000 every year, and you might not have enough work for them to do all the time. So, you end up paying for time they're not working. But don't worry, we have a better way to help you!<br><br>Enter Futuremerce, where you pay a simple monthly fee to receive the development work you need completed. Additionally, with the pause feature, you only pay for the service when you actually need it so you can use it one month, then stop for a bit when you don't need any work completed. Then start again once you need some more development done.",
